A Vue 3 application that quizzes you on common chess openings. It displays the position after a few moves, asks you to name the opening, and tracks your progress over time.

Features:
Uses chess.js to apply SAN moves and compute FEN.
Chessboard rendered with CSS Grid and Unicode symbols.
Randomized deck of openings that won't repeat until you’ve seen them all.
Persistent stats in localStorage: total answered, correct, current streak, best streak.
Responsive layout with a sidebar on desktop and a single‑column view on mobile.
Keyboard support: Enter to submit and Enter to advance to the next opening.
